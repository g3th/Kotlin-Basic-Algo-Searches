# Kotlin Basic Algorithm Searches
## Includes: Bubble Sort, Jump Search, Linear Search and more.

This excercise includes implementing different algorithms which search for phone numbers in a phone-book. 

The program will first sort the list using bubble sort, then attempt to match queries first by linear search, then using various other search algorithms.

There are two small lists, used to test, and original lists. The original directory has one million names, so sorting it with bubble sort isn't recommended as it will take a long time.

Finally, the program measures the performance of each algorithm, outputting the time taken for each of the searches.

BubbleSort - performance Data for lists of Various Sizes:

5000(words) - Sorting Time: 0 min. 0 sec. 701 ms.
10000 - Sorting Time: 0 min. 3 sec.  76 ms.
12000 - Sorting Time: 0 min. 4 sec. 456 ms.
50000 - Sorting Time: 1 min. 23 sec. 161 ms.
100000 - Sorting Time: 1 min. 21 sec. 161 ms.
200000 - Sorting Time: 22 min. 59 sec. 916 ms.
