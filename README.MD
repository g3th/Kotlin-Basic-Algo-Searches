# Kotlin Basic Algorithm Searches
## Includes: Bubble Sort, Jump Search, Linear Search and more.

This exercise includes implementing different algorithms which search for phone numbers in a phone-book. 

The program will first sort the list using bubble sort, then attempt to match queries first by linear search, then using various other search algorithms.

There are two small lists, used to test, and original lists. The original directory has one million names, so sorting it with bubble sort isn't recommended as it will take a long time.

Finally, the program measures the performance of each algorithm, outputting the time taken for each of the searches.

Algorithms used:

Linear Search
Bubble Sort + Jump Search
Quick Sort + Binary Search
Kotlin Map (to implement a hashMap)

TO DO:

Add search times + clean-up project (divide into different modules, add classes)
